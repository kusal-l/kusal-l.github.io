Passionate about technology, I thrive on solving complex problems creatively. As an undergraduate student in network engineering, I am actively expanding my knowledge and skills in different areas.

My passion lies in the tech side of things, particularly in working with servers and tackling challenges head-on. I am known for my hard work ethic and innovative problem-solving ideas.

This is a fun thing i work on in my free time. For myself to be keep track of things i do, wanted to do and maybe the stuff I see in day-to-day life.
